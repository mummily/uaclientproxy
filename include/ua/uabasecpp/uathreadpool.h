 *  of threads is used to execute worker thread jobs. Jobs are passed in as UaThreadPoolJob.
 *
 *  If all threads of the thread pool are busy, the jobs are added to a job pool. Jobs from the
 *  job pool will be processed by the next available threads. The job pool size is four times the
 *  maximum numbers of threads in the thread pool.
 *
 *  During the creation of the thread pool a minimum and maximum number of threads is defined.
 *  The thread pool creates the minimum number of threads when it is created. It creates more threads
 *  if needed but not more than defined as maximum.
 *
 *  See UaThreadPoolJob for an example.
 *
 *  The default and copy constructor and the copy operator are private and not supported.
